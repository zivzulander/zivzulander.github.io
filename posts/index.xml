<p><strong>The Magic That is Me</strong> the first musical by Colour Me Sad. It explores many emotions including love, excitement, anxiety and calm. The musical follows a dream sequence experienced by Max, a young girl who splits her time between her mom’s house and her dad’s house. She loses all the colour in her rainbow bedroom and goes on an adventure through a dreamland to retrieve the lost colours. The album, now available to stream on all platforms, is a genre-jumping adventure that models emotion using thoughtful arrangements and styles to tell the story.</p>
