Here I will be creating a clever volume indicator for linux systems without a dedicated desktop environment. The end result is to look nice: Full script can be found on my GitHub.
It must serve the following:
work with Pipewire work with Dunst allow for incremental increases in volume called from keybinding such as sxhkd round appropriately to save my ocd from seeing numbers like 37% mute if volume reaches 0% Basic setup</description></item><item><title>endeavours</title><link>https://mattmorris.ca/endeavours/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattmorris.ca/endeavours/</guid><description>Music With Mandy Composer, pianist Colour Me Sad Composer, pianist The Magic That is Me the first musical by Colour Me Sad.

Seafile is a free and open source file syncing tool that can be self-hosted on a raspberry pi. While there are other tools you can use to sync your data, Seafile has a few advantages:
access data remotely over https send or share files and folders with other users or guests edit documents right in the browser simple WebDAV setup 2FA iOS clients data de-duplication multi-user support There is one well-known disadvantage: Files are stored in a proprietary format which can&amp;rsquo;t be accessed through a normal file browser.</description></item><item><title>Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, Bazarr and Deluge On Raspberry Pi 4</title><link>https://mattmorris.ca/projects/jellyfin_on_raspberrypi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattmorris.ca/projects/jellyfin_on_raspberrypi/</guid><description>Updated on September 01, 2022.
The following will get you started with Jellyfin, Radarr, Sonarr, Bazarr and Deluge running on a Raspberry Pi. Setup your pi with 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS and mount your storage media before continuing.
Install docker curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh Add docker to the usergroup pi.
sudo usermod -aG docker pi Make a folder for all the config data. I keep it all on my usb HDD.</description></item><item><title>music</title><link>https://mattmorris.ca/music/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattmorris.ca/music/</guid><description>Music With Mandy Composer, pianist Colour Me Sad Composer, pianist The Magic That is Me the first musical by Colour Me Sad.
